Bitwise operators in C perform operations on the individual bits of integers.
They include AND (&), OR (1), XOR (^), NOT (~), left shift (<<"), and right shift (`>>`). 
These operators are commonly used for tasks like setting, clearing, and toggling specific bits, performing fast arithmetic operations, 
and optimizing memory usage in low- level programming and embedded systems.
