**Bitwise Operators in C**
Bitwise operators in C perform operations on the individual bits of integers. They include AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), left shift (<<), and right shift (>>). These operators are commonly used for tasks like setting, clearing, and toggling specific bits, performing fast arithmetic operations, and optimizing memory usage in low-level programming and embedded systems.

**1. Bitwise AND (&)**
The bitwise AND operation is used to find the common set bits of a and b. These common set bits indicate where carries need to be added in binary addition.

Binary Representation
a = 100 (binary for 4)
b = 101 (binary for 5)


int data = a & b;

   a = 1 0 0
   b = 1 0 1  
data = 1 0 0 (4 in binary)
In this operation:

The third bit from the right: Both a and b have 1, so the result is 1 (indicating a carry).
Identifying Carry Bits
Common Set Bits: The bitwise AND operation identifies positions where both a and b have 1. These are the positions where a carry will occur in binary addition.


**2. Bitwise XOR (^)**
The bitwise XOR operation compares each corresponding bit of two integers and returns a new integer where each bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bits of the original integers are different. If the corresponding bits are the same, the bit in the resulting integer is set to 0.


a = a ^ b;

   a = 1 0 0
   b = 1 0 1

a ^ b = 0 0 1

**3. Left Shift (<<)** multiplies the current value by 2.
The carry bits identified need to be added to the next higher bit position in the subsequent iteration. Hence, data is shifted left by one position (data << 1).


b = data << 1;

b = data << 1 = 1000 (8) âŸ¶ carries shifted left
The common set bit is in the third position (from the right), indicating that there is a carry from the third position to the fourth position in binary addition.


**4. Right Shift (>>) ** moves to the next bit of the multiplier. The right shift operator (>>) shifts all bits of its operand to the right by the specified number of positions. Each shift to the right divides the number by 2, discarding the least significant bit (LSB).
b = 101 (5)

b= b >>= 1 shifts b to the right by 1 bit, effectively dividing b by 2.
b= 10 (2)
